## CloudFormation Physical & Logical Resources

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation).png)

CloudFormation Template
	\- a document written in either YAML or JSON.
	- used to create Stacks.

Logical Resources
	\- defined within a template.
	\- what you want to create.

Portable Template
	\- a template that can be used many times in many accounts in many regions.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-1](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-1.png)

* Initial job of a Stack is to create physical resources based from the logical resources defined in a template.
* Once a logical resource moves to create_complete (meaning the physical resources is active) it can be queried for attributes of the physical resource within the template.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-2](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-2.png)

* If a Stack template is updated/changed/deleted, the physical resources are also updated/changed/deleted.

## CloudFormation Template and Pseudo Parameters

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-3](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-3.png)

* Both Template Parameters and Pseudo Parameters allow input into CloudFormation.
* Parameters are defined inside a template along with the resources.
* Values for those parameters can be referenced within logical resources also within the template which allows them influence the Stack provisioning.
* Can be configured with Defaults, AllowedValues, Min and Max length & AllowedPatterns, NoEcho & Type.

Template Parameters
	\- means that the human or automated process can provide input via the Console, CLI or API when a stack is created or updated.

Pseudo Parameters
	\- provided by AWS.
	\- AWS makes these parameters available which can be referenced when creating the stack.
	\- exists even if you don’t define them.

**Template Parameter Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-4](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-4.png)

**Pseudo Parameter Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-5](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-5.png)

* Think of it as being injected by AWS into the template and Stack.
* Aim to minimize the number of parameters which require explicit input.

## CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions

* Intrinsic Functions allow you to gain access to data at runtime.
* Templates can take actions based on how things are when the template is being used to create a Stack.

Ref & Fn::GetAtt
	\- allows you to reference a value from 1 logical resource in another one.

Fn::Join & Fn::Split
	\- allow you to join or split strings.

Fn::GetAZs
	\- used to get a list of Availability Zones for a given AWS Region.

Fn::Select
	\- allows you to select an element from a list.

Conditional Logic Functions (Fn::IF, And, Equals, Not & Or)
	\- can be used to provision resources based on conditional checks.

Fn::Base64
	\- input a non-encoded text to output in a certain AWS service in a Base64 encoded manner.

Fn::Sub
	\- allows you to substitute things within a text based on runtime information.

Fn::Cidr
	\- let’s you build CIDR blocks for networking.

Other Functions:

* Fn::ImportValue
* Fn::Transform
* Fn::FindInMap

**Ref & Fn::GetAtt Sample**

## CloudFormation Mappings

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-11](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-11.png)

* Mappings object can contain many mapping logical resources.
* Each of these maps keys to values allowing information lookup.
* Can have Top and Second level keys.
* Mappings use the !FindInMap intrinsic function.

**Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-12](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-12.png)

* Always need to provide a Top Level key.
* You can perform 1 or 2 Level lookups using !FindInMap.

## CloudFormation Outputs

* Optional within a template.
* Useful in providing status information.
* Visible as outputs in the Console and CLI.
* Accessible from a parent stack when using nesting.

**Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-13](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-13.png)

## CloudFormation Conditions

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-14](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-14.png)

* A feature in CloudFormation which allows a Stack to react to certain conditions.
* An optional section of a template.
* Conditions are evaluated to be True or False.
* Processed first before resources are created.
* Use other intrinsic functions And, Equals, If, Not & Or.

**Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-15](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-15.png)

## CloudFormation DependsOn

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-16](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-16.png)

DependsOn
	\- allows you to establish formal dependencies between resources within CloudFormation templates.

* CloudFormation tries to be efficient by doing things in parallel.
* It also tries to determine a dependency order.

**Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-17](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-17.png)

## CloudFormation Wait Conditions & cfn-signal

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-18](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-18.png)

* Allows systems to provide more detailed signals on completion to CloudFormation.
* Ensures resources are provisioned correctly before moving onto the next stage.

cfn-signal
	\- allows CloudFormation to hold or pause a resource or to wait for a certain number of signals.
	\- allows you to configure a Timeout (H:M:S) for those signals (12 hours max).

* Once configured it means that a logical resource will just wait until the number of success signal is receive by CloudFormation within the timeout period.
* If signals are received then it only changes to CREATE_COMPLETE.

**Creation Policy Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-19](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-19.png)

CreationPolicy
	\- are mainly used for EC2 instances or Auto-Scaling Groups.

**WaitCondition Sample**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-20](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-20.png)

* Data passed back can be accessed from anywhere in the template.

WaitCondition
	\- can depend on other resources.
	\- other resources can also depend on the WaitCondition.
	\- offers a more general progress gate. 

WaitHandle
	\- sole purpose is to generate a pre-signed URL which can be used to send signals to.
	\- does not require AWS credentials to make use of the URL.
	\- useful for external systems.
	\- accepts JSON as means of signal.

## CloudFormation Nested Stacks

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-21](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-21.png)

* Resources in a single stack share a lifecycle.
* There is a limit of 500 resources per stack.
* Reusing of resources is not possible with a single stack.

Root Stack
	\- stack that gets created first.
	\- only component of a stack that gets created manually by an entity.

Parent Stack
	\- the parent of any stacks which it immediately creates.
	\- any stack that has its own nested stack.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-22](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-22.png)

* You can only reference outputs when using nested stacks.
* Templates can be reused in other stacks.
* You are reusing the code/template not the resources/stacks that are created.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-23](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-23.png)

## CloudFormation Cross-Stack References

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-24](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-24.png)

* Things in one stack can’t be by default referenced in another.
* Best used for actually reusing existing resources in stacks. 
* Outputs can be exported which makes them visible from other stacks.
* Exports must have a unique name in one region of your account.
* Fn::ImportValue can be used instead of Ref

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-25](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-25.png)

* Cross-Region or Cross-Account isn’t supported for Cross-Stack references.

## CloudFormation Stack Sets

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-26](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-26.png)

StackSets 
	\- are a feature which allows you to create, update or delete infrastructure across many regions in many AWS accounts.
	\- allows you to deploy CloudFormation stacks across many regions and accounts.
	\- are containers in an admin account.
	\- each stack runs in 1 region of 1 account.
	\- Contain stack instances which are essentially references of stacks.

Target account
	\- normal AWS accounts that StackSets target to deploy resources into.

**StackSet Architecture**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-27](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-27.png)

* Permissions are granted via Self-Managed IAM roles or Service-Managed Roles with an AWS Organization.

Concurrent Accounts
	\- defines how many individual AWS accounts can be used at the same time.
	\- meaning the amount of accounts that can be deployed into at the same time.

Failure Tolerance
	\- the amount of individual deployments which can fail before the StackSet is viewed as failed.

Retain Stacks
	\- removes stack instances from a stack set while keeping the stacks and their resources.

* Resources remain in their current state.
* The stack is no longer part of the stack set.
* The stacks are left in their individual accounts and regions.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-28](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-28.png)

## CloudFormation Deletion Policy

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-29](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-29.png)

* By default, if you delete a logical resource from a template the physical resource is deleted.
* Deletion Policy only applies to delete style operations not replace.

Deletion Policy
	\- definable on each resource which allows you to specify actions that CloudFormation takes when deleting that resource.

* Default: Delete both logical and physical resource
* Retain: CFN will not delete the physical resource if logical resource is deleted.
* Snapshot (If Supported): A Snapshot is taken before deletion.

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-30](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-30.png)

## CloudFormation Stack Roles

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-31](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-31.png)

* By default, CloudFormation uses the permissions of the identity who is creating the stack to create AWS resources.

CloudFormation Stack Roles
	\- a feature which allows CloudFormation to assume a role to gain permissions required to interact with AWS to create, delete or update resources.

* With this the only permissions needed by the identity creating the stack only needs permissions on that stack and PassRole permissions.

**CloudFormation Stack Roles Architecture**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-32](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-32.png)

## CloudFormation Init (cfn-init)

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-33](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-33.png)

* Another way that you can provide configuration information to an EC2 instance.
* UserData allows you to tell the system How you want it to bootstrap itself.
* CFN init is a desired state system meaning you only define What you want to occur.

**cfn-init Architecture**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-34](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-34.png)

* cfn-init is installed via UserData.

cfn-signal
	\- used for telling CloudFormation when bootstrapping is complete.

Config Keys
	\- containers of configuration directives.

## CloudFormation cfn-hup

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-35](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-35.png)

cfn-init
	\- is a run once as part of bootstrapping.
	\- loads metadata stored within a logical resource in a CFN stack.
	\- a desired state configuration tool.

* If cfn-init is update it won’t be re-run.

cfn-hup
	\- a tool you can install in an EC2 instance.
	\- it detects changes in a resources metadata.
	\- allows to perform an update operation when cfn-init template is changed.

**cfn-hup Architecture**

## CloudFormation ChangeSets

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-37](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-37.png)

Change Sets
	\- a feature which makes it safer to use CloudFormation within a full infrastructure as code environment.
	\- let you apply a new template to a stack, but instead of applying it immediately it creates an overview of changes to be made to the stack.

**Change Sets Architecture**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-38](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-38.png)

## CloudFormation Custom Resources

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-39](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-39.png)

* CloudFormation doesn’t support everything in AWS.
* CFN sends data to an endpoint that you define within that custom resource (Lambda or SNS).

CFN Custom Resources
	\- lets CloudFormation integrate with anything it doesn’t yet support, doesn’t natively support, or external system integrations.

**CFN Custom Resources Sample Scenario**

![Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)-40](images/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(CloudFormation)-40.png)

## CloudFormation Extras

aws cloudformation package
	\- a command packages the local artifacts (local paths) that your AWS CloudFormation template references.
	\- uploads local artifacts, such as source code for an AWS Lambda function or a Swagger file for an AWS API Gateway REST API, to an S3 bucket.
	\- returns a copy of your template, replacing references to local artifacts with the S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.

aws cloudformation deploy
	\- to deploy the returned template of `aws cloudformation package`.
