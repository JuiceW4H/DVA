* CloudHSMs are not deployed inside a VPC that you control, but instead AWS Managed CloudHSM VPC.
* HSMs by Default is not an HA device.
* Once HSM devices are configured as a cluster, they are able to replicate any keys, policies or other configurations in that cluster.
* Injected via ENIs in Customer VPCs.
* A client needs to be installed on EC2 instances to utilize the CloudHSM devices.
* AWS have no access to secure area where key material is held.

**Use Case**

* No Native AWS Integration between CloudHSM and any AWS products.
* Can be used to offload SSL or TLS processing from web servers.
* Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Oracle Databases or MS SQL.
* Protect the private keys for an issuing Certificate Authority.
