## AppSync

* A managed service that uses GraphQL.
* Realtime Web Socket integration.
* Allows for local data access and synchronization.
* A serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications.
* Provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.

GraphQL
	\- makes it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.
	\- combines data from one or more sources.

## AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

* Framework for developing and deploying serverless applications.
* Configured in YAML format.
* Supports anything from CloudFormation.
* SAM is made of Recipes.

Transform Header
	\-indicates that a template is a SAM template.

sam build
	\- for building the application locally by combining the template.yml and application code (deployment artifacts).
	\- resolving any dependencies the application might have.

sam package
	\- package the application to zip file and upload to S3 bucket.

sam deploy
	\- CLI command to package and deploy with SAM.

sam sync
	\- synchronize code and infrastructure.

sam sync --code
	\- synchronize code changes with updating infrastructure.

sam sync --code --resource <Resource/>

sam sync --code --resource-id <Resource ID/>

sam sync --watch
	\- monitor for file changes and synchronize when detected.

SAM Accelerate
	\- a set of features used to reduce latency while deploying resources to AWS.

CodeUri Parameter
	\-  accepts the S3 URL of your code and not the actual code itself.

Handler Parameter
	\- used to specify the name of the handler, which is just a function in your code that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes your code.

## AWS Cognito Sync

* An AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data
* You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend.
* The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status.

## AWS Config

![Security, Deployment, and Operations-08-07-2024-6](images/Security,%20Deployment,%20and%20Operations-08-07-2024-6.png)

* Primary function is to record changes over time on resources within an AWS Account.
* Every time a resource configuration changes, a configuration item is created which stores the configuration of that resource at a specific point in time.
* Information stored is the configuration of the resource, relationship to other resources and who makes any changes.
* Regional services and also supports Cross-Region and Cross Account Aggregation.
* Changes can generate SNS notifications and near-realtime events via EventBridge & Lambda.
* You cannot store Certificates here.

**Use Case**

* Auditing changes
* Compliance with standards

Config Rules
	\- allow you to evaluate the configuration of your AWS resources.
	\- either AWS Managed or Custom Rules (using Lambda).

## Kinesis Client Library

* Ensures that for every shard there is a record processor running and processing that shard.
* It also tracks the shards in the stream using an Amazon DynamoDB table.
* When new shards are created as a result of resharding, the KCL discovers the new shards and populates new rows in the table.
* The KCL also distributes the shards in the stream across all the available workers and record processors.

## Kinesis Adapter
 
* Allows you to leverage the design patterns found within the KCL to process DynamoDB Streams shards and stream records.
* Implements the Kinesis Streams interface, so that the KCL can be used for consuming and processing records from DynamoDB Streams.

## Lambda Authorizer

* An API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API.

**2 Types of Lambda Authorizers**

1. Token-based Lambda Authorizer (TOKEN authorizer)
	\- receives the caller’s identity in a bearer token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or an OAuth token.

2. Request Parameter-based Lambda Authorizer (REQUEST authorizer)
	\- receives the caller’s identity in a combination of headers, query string parameters, stageVariables, and $context variables.

## AWS CLI

* By default, the AWS CLI uses a page size of 1000 and retrieves all available items.

--page-size
	\- to specify that the AWS CLI request a smaller number of items from each call to the AWS service.

--max-items
	\- prints out only the number of items at a time that you specify.

* If the number of items output is fewer than the total number of items returned by the underlying API calls, the output includes a NextToken that you can pass to a subsequent command to retrieve the next set of items.

-size-only
	\- accepts a boolean value and is typically used along with “s3 sync” command.
	\- makes the size of each key the only criteria to use to decide whether to sync from source to destination.

-exclude
	\- simply makes Amazon S3 exclude all files or objects that match a specified pattern from the result of the command.

-summary
	\- displays the summary information (number of objects, total size) of objects returned from an “s3 ls” command.

## Database Locking Strategies

* Databases employ locking mechanisms to ensure that data is always updated to the latest version and is concurrent.

**Types of Locking Mechanisms**

1. Optimistic Locking
	\-  a strategy to ensure that the client-side item that you are updating (or deleting) is the same as the item in DynamoDB.
	\- each item has an attribute that acts as a version number.

* @DynamoDBVersionAttribute can be used to implement Optimistic Locking for applications that are using AWS SDK for Java.

DynamoDBMapper
	\- assigns a version number when you first save the object, and it automatically increments the version number each time you update the item.
	\- update or delete requests will succeed only if the client-side object version matches the corresponding version number of the item in the DynamoDB table.

2. Pessimistic Locking
	\- an approach where an entity is locked in the database for the entire time that it is in application memory (often in the form of an object).
	\- can prevent certain users from reading, updating, or deleting an entry depending on the lock type.
	\- actively prevents others from changing the data while you’re working on it. It’s like putting a “do not touch” sign on the data.

3. Overly Optimistic Locking
	\- used for systems that have only one user or operation performing changes at a single time.
	\- changes are saved without verifying if the data has been modified since it was read.

## AWS Amplify

Amplify Hosting
	\- provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment.
	\- provides deep integration with Cypress for End-to-End (E2E) testing.

* To add Cypress tests to your application, you can update the build settings in the amplify.yml configuration file, which will enable Amplify to run the tests during the build process.

Amplify Studio
	\- a visual development environment that simplifies the creation of scalable, full-stack web and mobile apps.

## CloudFront Function

* Can only be invoked during two specific events:
	\- when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request).
	\- before CloudFront returns the response to the viewer (viewer response).

## AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

* Part of a broader industry solution in which X-Ray is only one of many tracing solutions.

* It is recommended to instrument your application with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry if you need the following:
	* The ability to send traces to multiple different tracing backends without having to re-instrument your code.
	* Support for a large number of library instrumentations for each language, maintained by the OpenTelemetry community
	* Fully managed Lambda layers that package everything you need to collect telemetry data without requiring code changes when using Java, Python, or Node.js

## Cluster Query Language

* Expressions that you can use to group container instances by a specific attribute

Attributes
	\- custom metadata to your container instances.
