## AppSync

* A managed service that uses GraphQL.
* Realtime Web Socket integration.
* Allows for local data access and synchronization.
* A serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications.
* Provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.

GraphQL
	\- makes it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.
	\- combines data from one or more sources.

## AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

* Framework for developing and deploying serverless applications.
* Configured in YAML format.
* Supports anything from CloudFormation.
* SAM is made of Recipes.

Transform Header
	\-indicates that a template is a SAM template.

sam build
	\- for building the application locally by combining the template.yml and application code (deployment artifacts).
	\- resolving any dependencies the application might have.

sam package
	\- package the application to zip file and upload to S3 bucket.

sam deploy
	\- CLI command to package and deploy with SAM.

sam sync
	\- synchronize code and infrastructure.

sam sync --code
	\- synchronize code changes with updating infrastructure.

sam sync --code --resource <Resource/>

sam sync --code --resource-id <Resource ID/>

sam sync --watch
	\- monitor for file changes and synchronize when detected.

SAM Accelerate
	\- a set of features used to reduce latency while deploying resources to AWS.

CodeUri Parameter
	\- Â accepts the S3 URL of your code and not the actual code itself.

Handler Parameter
	\- used to specify the name of the handler, which is just a function in your code that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes your code.

## AWS Cognito Sync

* An AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data
* You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend.
* The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status.

## AWS Config

![Security, Deployment, and Operations-08-07-2024-6](images/Security,%20Deployment,%20and%20Operations-08-07-2024-6.png)

* Primary function is to record changes over time on resources within an AWS Account.
* Every time a resource configuration changes, a configuration item is created which stores the configuration of that resource at a specific point in time.
* Information stored is the configuration of the resource, relationship to other resources and who makes any changes.
* Regional services and also supports Cross-Region and Cross Account Aggregation.
* Changes can generate SNS notifications and near-realtime events via EventBridge & Lambda.
* You cannot store Certificates here.

**Use Case**

* Auditing changes
* Compliance with standards

Config Rules
	\- allow you to evaluate the configuration of your AWS resources.
	\- either AWS Managed or Custom Rules (using Lambda).
