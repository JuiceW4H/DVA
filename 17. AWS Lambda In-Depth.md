## Lambda Handler Architecture & Overview

![AWS Lambda In-Depth](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth.png)

* Lambda Functions executions have lifecycles.

Lambda Execution Environment
	\- where Lambda is logically executed from.

Init
	\- where the execution environment is created or unfrozen.

Invoke
	\- runs the function handler for the first time (Cold Start).

* If you run the same function again fairly quickly it will re-run it faster compared to its first invoke as it is using the same environment (Warm Start). 

Shutdown
	\- termination of the Lambda Execution Environment.

**Init Components**

* Extension Init
* Runtime Init
* Function Init

**Shutdown Components**

* Runtime Shutdown
* Extension Shutdown

**2 Main Parts of a Lambda Function**

1. Function Initialization Code
	\- executed once during Cold Starts or specifically the function init stage.
	\- can be performed in advanced if you use provisioned concurrency.

2. Handler Function
	\- component of the code that the Lambda product passes event data into.
	\- performs most of the logic that the Lambda function does.

* Lambda attempts to reuse an execution environment for multiple invocations of the same function.

Provisioned Concurrency
	\- pre-warms the execution environment in advance.
	\- runs the Cold Start part in advance.

## Lambda Versions

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-2](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-2.png)

* Unpublished functions can be changed and deployed.
* Functions can be published which creates an immutable version.
* Version includes function code, dependencies, runtime, settings and any environment variables.

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-3](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-3.png)

Qualified ARN 
	\- a unique ARN which points to a specific version.

Unqualified ARN
	\- which points at a function without specifying a version.
	\- defaults the latest version.

## Lambda Aliases

Alias
	\- a pointer to a function version.

* Each alias has a unique ARN fixed for the alias.
* Aliases can be updated or changed to which version they point to.
* Services that use Lambda can point at an alias rather than a function version.

Alias Routing
	\- allows you to define a distribution of requests between different versions.
	\- versions that will be pointed to must be published.

## Lambda Environment Variables

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-5](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-5.png)

* An Environment Variable in Lambda is a Key Value Pair.
* Every Lambda function can 0 or more environment variables.
* By Default, environment variables are associated with $LATEST.
* When published environment variables are also associated with that version and are also immutable.
* Can be accessed within the execution environment and encrypted with KMS.
* Allows code execution to be adjusted based on environment variables.

## Lambda Monitoring, Logging and Tracing

**Lambda Monitoring**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-6](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-6.png)

* All Lambda metrics are accessible within CloudWatch through Console, CLI or API.
* Data is available with a number of dimensions.

**Types of Data Accessible on CloudWatch**

* Invocations
* Errors
	* DeadLetterErrors
	* DestinationDeliveryFailures

* Duration
* Concurrent Executions

**Lambda Logging**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-7](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-7.png)

* Lambda sends its execution logs through to CloudWatch Logs.
* Any information which is printed to either standard out (stdout) or standard error (stderr) will be captured in the logs.
* A log group is created for every function.
	* Log Group Format: /aws/lambda/functionname

* Within log group there will be multiple log streams.
	* Log Stream Format: YYYY/MM/DD/[$LATEST || version]..<random char/num>

* Permissions are provided via Execution Role of that Lambda function.
* Default role gives basic logging permissions.

**Lambda Tracing**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-8](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-8.png)

* X-Ray gives visibility to the flow of requests through your applications.
* To use X-Ray with Lambda you can enable Active Tracing on a specific Lambda function.
* To enable it via CLI use the following command:
	* aws lambda update-function-configuration —function-name my-function —tracing-config Mode=Active

* Permissions are given through execution role. The following managed policy must be included in the execution role:
	* AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess

* Once managed role is provided X-Ray SDK is usable within your function.
* X-Ray related environment variable/s:
	* AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS
		- provides the connection details including port for the X-Ray Daemon.

## Lambda Layers

**Example Without Using Layers**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-9](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-9.png)

* Without Layers everything is contained within a single huge deployment ZIP File containing function code, libraries and even more libraries.
* If you want to slightly different function that utilize the same dependencies it would require multiple ZIPs containing the same huge dependencies.

**Example With Layers**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-10](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-10.png)

* Different ZIP files can now be smaller due to not carrying the same dependencies over and over again and will only contain the code.
* A single layer can be created for the libraries that and utilized by multiple functions.
* Any Layers which are used are extracted into the /opt folder inside the runtime environment and as such can be used in the same way as if the libraries were actually included within the function zip.
* Layers allow us to use new runtimes which are not currently supported by default and in addition allow libraries to be externalized.

## Lambda Container Images

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-11](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-11.png)

* Lambda is capable of being used with container images.
* Maintenance of existing build processes and build a container which can be deployed to Lambda.
* Built through the usual container build process, but you include the Lambda runtime API.

AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE)
	\- lets you do local testing.
	\- it emulates many of the interfaces for Lambda so that you can test it without using Lambda for real.

## Lambda & ALB Integration

**Example Architecture**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-13](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-13.png)

Synchronous Invocation
	\- response is waited upon requesting.

* ALB translates HTTP/S request into a Lambda compatible event (JSON Structure).
* Lambda responds in JSON which is translated back into HTTP/S response.

**Event (JSON) Sample from ALB and Response Sample from Lambda**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-14](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-14.png)

* As a developer all that is needed is to create the Lambda function code to interpret the JSON that the ALB send and create the JSON which is returned to the ALB.

**Multi-Value Headers**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-15](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-15.png)

* By using Multi-Value headers, the Load Balancer uses both key values sent by the client and sends you an event that includes query string parameters using multiValueQueryStringParameters.

## Lambda Resource Policy

* Every Lambda function has two forms of security.

Execution Role
	\- assumed by the function which determines what the Lambda function can do.

Resource Policy
	\- determines who can do what with the Lambda function.
	\- can be used to allow or deny identities access to a specific Lambda function.

**Same Account Architecture**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-16](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-16.png)

* In the same account, permissions are granted via identity policies or resource policies.
* You can have both, but only one or the other is required.

**Cross-Account Architecture**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-17](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-17.png)

* In cross-account access, the source account A needs to allow access out via an identity policy and the destination resource needs to allow access in via resource policy.
* Identity policy and resource policy are required for cross-account access.

**Resource Policy in AWS Console**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-18](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-18.png)

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-19](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-19.png)

**Summary**

![AWS Lambda In-Depth-20](images/AWS%20Lambda%20In-Depth-20.png)

* A service that is not able to assume roles will benefit from resource policies for invoking Lambda.
* Required when cross-account access is used.
