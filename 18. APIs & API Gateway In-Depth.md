## API Gateway - Methods and Resources

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth.png)

* Invoke URL points at the API Gateway Endpoint DNS name, stage and resources.

Stages
	\- logical configuration objects.
	\- APIs are deployed into here.
	\- can be used for different versions or lifecycle points for an API.

* APIs can only be accessed and changes only take effect when they’re deployed into a stage.
* Inside the API configuration is where you create resources (e.g. / or root resource).

Resources
	\- points in the API tree.
	\- bits of functionality within your API.
	\- example: / or root resource.

* For each resource you can have one or more methods.

Methods
	\- get, put, post, delete or options.
	\- what the client is doing to the resource or using to interact with the resource.
	\- where integrations are configured.

## API Gateway Integrations

**Overview**

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-1](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-1.png)

* API Gateway is an intermediary between clients and integrations.

Integrations
	\- backend services which provide functionality to API Gateway.

**3 Phases in API Gateway Integrations**

1. Request
	\- it authorizes, validates and transforms incoming requests from the client into a form that the integration can handle.

2. Backend Endpoint

3. Response
	\- takes the output from the integration transforms, prepares and returns it to the client.

**2 Parts of the Request Phase**

1. Method Request Phase
	\- defines everything about the client’s request to the method.
	\- anything which controls the interaction with the client.

2. Integration Request Phase
	\- where the parameters and other data from the method request are provided to the integration.

* Transfer of data from the method to the integration can involve translation or passed through as is which is called Proxying.

**2 Parts of the Response Phase**

1. Integration Response Phase
	\- handles the conversion of data provided by the backend endpoint into a form that the method can respond back to the client with.
	\- if proxying is used then it can pass it directly to the method.

2. Method Response
	\- how the communication is delivered back to the client.

* API Methods (Client Side) decide what the client request tot he method is like and are integrated with a backend endpoint.

**Different Types of Integrations**

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-2](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-2.png)

* Mock (Testing)
	\- allows API gateway to return a response without sending the request further towards any backend.
	\- useful for API testing.
	\- does not require a backend to be configured.

* HTTP
	\- lets an API expose HTTP endpoints in the backend.
	\- known as a HTTP custom integration.
	\- you have to configure both integration request and integration response.

	* HTTP_PROXY (Subtype of HTTP Integration)
		\- proxying is utilized.
		\- allows a client to access backend HTTP endpoints with a streamlined integration setup.
		\- does not require the configuration of integration request/response.

	Proxying
	\- where information is passed to the endpoint as is and information is accepted from the endpoint as is.

* Endpoint has to understand the format from API gateway and pass information back in a valid format to API gateway.

* AWS
	\- allows an API to expose AWS services.
	\- requires configuration of both integration request and response and setup necessary mappings from the method request/response to the integration request/response.

* AWS_PROXY (Lambda)
	\- where integration request and response don’t have to be defined.
	\- API gateway passes the data through unmodified.
	\- function is responsible for formats.

**Integration Type Visualization**

Mapping Template
\- used or AWS and HTTP (Non Proxy) Integrations.
\- allows to you modify or rename parameters between the method and the integration.
\- also for modifying the body or headers of the request.
\- can perform filtering.
\- uses the Velocity Template Language (VTL).

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-4](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-4.png)

* A mapping template sits between the client and the integration endpoint translating data between the two.

## API Gateway Stages and Deployments

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-5](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-5.png)

* When editing an API with an API gateway, changes made on it are not live (Similar to editing Unpublished changes in Lambda $LATEST).
* Current API state needs to be deployed to a stage.
* Each stage has its own configuration.

Stage
	\- a logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API.
	\- configurations stored within stages are mutable or can be overwritten and rolled back.

**Visualization**

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-6](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-6.png)

* Different stages have their own unique invoke URL.

**Enhanced with Stage Variables**

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-7](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-7.png)

Stage Variables
	\- key-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API.
	\- act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates.

Weighted Aliases
	\- direct a portion of traffic to a certain Lambda version and the remaining to another.

## Open API & Swagger

![APIs & API Gateway In-Depth-8](images/APIs%20&%20API%20Gateway%20In-Depth-8.png)

Open API Specification (OAS)
	\- formerly known as Swagger.
	\- OpenAPI v3 basically.
	\- an API description format for REST APIs.
	\- defines endpoints and operations.
	\- contains valid input and output parameters as well as authentication methods.
	\- contains non technical information.
	\- written in YAML or JSON.

Swagger
	\- OpenAPI v2

* API gateway can export to Swagger/OpenAPI & import from them.
