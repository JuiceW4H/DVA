![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family).png)

**Stages of a Code Project**

1. Code
	\- actual coding process, storage and version control of code.

2. Build
	\- taking source code, libraries and frameworks and putting it together to generate an output.

3. Test
	\- testing codes against various expectations.

4. Deploy
	\- getting code out to the compute environment that will run on.

* The entire process is called a Development Pipeline.

AWS CodePipeline
	\- an orchestration tool which can link different products in the Development Pipeline.

* A pipeline is linked to one and only one branch within a repository.

buildspec.yml (CodeBuild)
	\- a collection of build commands and related configuration that CodeBuild uses to run a build.
	\- can be included as part of the source code or defined when you create a build project.
	\- influences the way the build process occurs within the CodeBuild product.

buildspec Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html

appspec.yml/.json (CodeDeploy)
	\- allows you to influence exactly how a deployment process proceeds.

appspec reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file.html

* YAML or JSON files which influence CodeBuild or CodeDeploy respectively.
* Both in theory could refer to CodePipeline.

**Destinations that CodeDeploy can deploy into**

1. CodeDeploy
	\- can deploy an application onto one or more EC2 instances using a deployment group.

2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS OpsWorks
	\- with Elastic Beanstalk you have to specify an environment name.
	\- with OpsWorks you need to specify a stack and a layer.

3. CloudFormation
	\- used to create a new stack or update an existing stack or create a new or updated change sets.

4. Amazon ECS
	\- can be integrated directly into ECS or configure a deployment group to use a Blue/Green deployment model.

4. AWS Service Catalog or Alexa Skills Kit
5. Amazon S3
	\- store your built version in S3.

## AWS CodeCommit

* GitHub of AWS essentially.

Repository
	\- basic entity within CodeCommit.

**Ways of Accessing/Cloning in CodeCommit**

* Both can be setup on the IAM Console.

1. HTTPS
	\- authenticate using username and password.

2. SSH
	\- use an SSH key pair.

Notification Rule
	\- can send notification based on events in a repository.
	\- notifications can be sent to an SNS topic or AWS Chatbot (Slack).

Trigger
	\- allows to generate event driven processes based on events that happen on a repository.
	\- events can be sent to Amazon SNS or AWS Lambda.
	\- allows you to create event driven workflows.

## AWS CodePipeline for Developers 

**Overview of the CI/CD System within AWS**

![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)-1](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family)-1.png)

AWS CodePipeline
	\- glue or orchestration which makes all of the other components work together.
	\- a continuous delivery tool.
	\- controls the flow from source code, through build towards deployment.

Pipelines
	\- are built from Stages.

Stages
	\- contain actions which are either sequential or parallel actions.
	\- the movement between stages can be automatic or based on manual approval steps.

* Actions within stages can consume or generate artifacts.

Artifacts
	\- files which are stored on an S3 bucket linked to the pipeline that are consumed or generated.

* State Changes generates events which are published to the Event Bridge.

**Types of Actions in a Stage**

* Single Actions
* Parallel Actions
* Sequential Actions

Input Artifact
	\- consumed artifact.

Output Artifact
	\- generated artifact.

## AWS CodeBuild

![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)-3](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family)-3.png)

CodeBuild
	\- a Build as a Service product.
	\- it lets you control a managed build where you only pay for the resources consumed during the build process.
	\- used for builds and tests.
	\- uses Docker for build environment which can also be customized.

![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)-4](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family)-4.png)

* It gets sourced from GitHub, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and S3.
* Environment it uses can be customized via buildspec.yaml/.yml (file should be in the root of the source).

buildspec.yaml/.yml*
	\- customizes what happens during the build process.
	
**Components of a buildspec file**

1. 4 Main Phases

	* install
		\- generally used when you need to install base level things in the build environments (e.g. frameworks or other tooling).
		\- not for code dependencies.
		\- only for major environment installations.

	* pre_build
		\- where you can sign into things or install dependencies required by the application.

	* build
		\- runs the commands used to build the application.

	* post_build
		\- used to package things up or to push docker images or to do explicit notifications.

2. Environment Variables
	\- related to shell or environment variables.
	\- integrates with SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

3. Artifacts
	\- customizes the what and where of the build outputs.

## AWS CodeDeploy for Developers

![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)-6](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family)-6.png)

* Code Deployment as a Service
* It only deploys code not the resources.
* Capable of deploying code to EC2 instances, on-premises servers , Lambda and ECS.
* It can also deploy pre-built applications, web applications, configurations, exe files, packages, scripts, media and more.
* To use CodeDeploy for on-premises or EC2 instances you need to have the CodeDeploy agent installed.

![AWS CLI, Developer Tools & CICD (Code Family)-7](images/AWS%20CLI,%20Developer%20Tools%20&%20CICD%20(Code%20Family)-7.png)

appspec.yaml/.yml/.json*
	\- YAML or JSON formatted.
	\- it controls how deployments occur on the targets of that deployment.
	\- contains both configuration and lifecycle event hooks.
	\- placed at the root of the directory of an application’s source code.

**3 Components of Configuration**

1. Files
	\- only applies to EC2 and On premises servers.
	\- provides information to CodeDeploy about which files from your application should be installed on the instance during the deployments install.

2. Resources
	\- only applies to ECS and Lambda.
	\- for Lambda it contains the name, alias, current version, and target version of a Lambda function.
	\- for ECS it contains the task definition or the container and port details used for routing traffic to your container.
	\- configuration essentially.

3. Permissions
	\- only applies to EC2 and On premises servers.
	\- details any special permissions and how they should be applied to the files, directories and folders, which are defined in the files section.

Lifecycle Event Hooks
	\- function depends on the compute platform that you’re using for your deployment.

**Types of Lifecycle Event Hooks**

* ApplicationStop
	\- occurs before the application is downloaded.
	\- you can specify scripts to control events to stop the application or remove any currently installed packages in preparation for the deployment.
	\- used to prepare for the actual deployment itself.

* DownloadBundle
	\- when the CodeDeploy agent copies the application down to a temporary location.

* BeforeInstall
	\- an event that you can use for any pre-installation tasks.

* Install
	\- agent copies the application files from the temporary location to the final destination folder.
	\- not allowed to run any scripts during this step.

* AfterInstall
	\- allows you to perform post-install steps.

* ApplicationStart
	\- used when you want to restart or start any services that were stopped by the ApplicationStop component.

* ValidateService
	\- where you verify that the deployment is completed successfully.

* If used on EC2 or On premises servers, then each of these lifecycle event hooks runs one or more scripts for each of the hooks.
* If deploying to Lambda or ECS then each of these event hooks specifies Lambda functions to run during each of the deployment lifecycle stages.
* If an event hook is not then no operations are executed for that event.

## Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

* A Managed Container Image Registry Service.
* Docker Hub for AWS.
* Each AWS account has a Public and Private registry.
* Each registry can have many repositories.
* Each repository can contain many images.
* Images can have several tags (have to be unique in the repository).

Public Registry
	\- means that anyone can have read-only access to anything within that registry.
	\- read-write requires permissions.
	\- anyone can pull, to push you need permissions.

Private Registry
	\- permissions are required for any operation (read, read-write, push, and pull).

**Benefits:**

* Integrated with IAM
* Offers Image Scanning
	* Basic
	* Enhanced (Inspector Product)
* Offers near real-time metrics delivered into CloudWatch (Auth, Push, Pull).
* Logs API actions into CloudTrail.
* Generates events which are delivered into EventBridge.
* Offers replication of Container Images.
	* Cross-Region
	* Cross-Account
