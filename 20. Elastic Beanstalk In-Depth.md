## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Architecture

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth.png)

Elastic Beanstalk
	\- a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product within AWS.
	\- provides Managed Application Environments.

* User provides code and EB handles the environment.

Platform as a Service
	\- vendor handles all of the infrastructure.

* Elastic Beanstalk behind the scenes uses AWS products.
* It creates and manages all those resources using CloudFormation.
* Elastic Beanstalk requires application support.

**Elastic Beanstalk Platforms**

* Languages = Platforms

**3 Main Types of Platforms**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-1](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-1.png)

1. Natively Supported Platforms
	\- runtimes which Beanstalk supports natively.
	\- examples are the following: 

	* Go
	* Java SE
	* Tomcat
	* .NET Core (Linux)
	* .NET (Windows)
	* Node.js
	* PHP
	* Python
	* Ruby

2. Docker
	\- allows you to force anything that is needed or simply any Docker contained application into Beanstalk.

	* Single Container Docker
		\- allows you to store a Docker image on a repository and download this straight into Elastic Beanstalk if you want to run just a single containerized application.

	* Multi-container Docker
		\- are for applications which uses multiple containers.
		\- uses ECS behind the scenes to coordinate multiple containers.

	* Pre-configured Docker
		\- essentially for using languages that isn’t natively supported by Beanstalk.

3. Custom Platforms (Packer)
	\- makes use of Packer which is a product used for creating your own custom platform, so custom runtimes, which can be used with Beanstalk.

**Architecture**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-2](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-2.png)

Elastic Beanstalk Application
	\- a collection of things relating to an application.
	\- a container or folder.

Application Versions
	\- a specific labeled version of deployable code for an application.

Source bundle
	\- a collection versions of a specific application which are stored in S3.
	\- either ZIP or WAR files.

* Within a Beanstalk Application container there are one or more environments.
* It’s within environments that you deploy and run a specific application version.

**2 Types of Environment Tiers**

1. Web Server Tier (Frontend)
	\- designed to communicate with end users.

2. Worker Tier (Backend)
	\- designed to process work in some way from the web tiers.

* Worker Tier scales based on the number of messages in the queue.
* Web Server Tier scales based on the incoming requests to the load balancers.
* Each environment is running a specific application version at any one time.
* Different application version can be freely deployed into environments running within the application container.
* Each environment has its own DNS CNAME.

CNAME Swap
	\- swaps the CNAMEs of the environments.

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-3](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-3.png)

* Use docker for anything unsupported.
* Default to Databases being created outside of Elastic Beanstalk.
* Databases created within an EB environment are lost if the environment is deleted.

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Deployment Policies

* How application versions are deployed in an environment within Elastic Beanstalk.

**Deployment Policies**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-4](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-4.png)

1. All at Once
	\- new application version is deployed onto all instances within the EB environment at the same time.
	\- causes outages during deployment and no great method for handling failures.

2. Rolling Deployment
	\- deployment of new application version in batches.
	\- has additional control and much safer at the cost of lost in capacity.

* Each batch is taken out of service, the new application version is deployed onto that batch then put back into service when it passes health checks.

3. Rolling with Additional Batch
	\- rather than instances being removed from service, upgraded and returned, an extra batch of instances is instead added.

4. Immutable 
	\- a new temporary Auto Scaling Group is created with new instances running the new application version.
	\- once the instances passed the health they are moved to the original ASG.
	\- the original instances are terminated and the temporary ASG is removed.

5. Traffic Splitting
	\-  new ASG is created with new instances with new application version.
	\- allows you to control distribution of traffic between old and new version.
	\- comes at an additional cost.

6. Blue/Green Deployment
	\- deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap CNAMEs of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly.

**All at Once Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-5](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-5.png)

* All instances receive the deployment at the same time.
* Only has 2 possible outcomes either all or nothing is working.

**Rolling Deployment Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-6](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-6.png)

* One batch is disconnected and updated with the latest deployment.
* It is only when a batch finishes that another batch starts the cycle.
* You need to pick a batch size based on how many instances you can tolerate to be offline.

**Rolling with Additional Batch Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-7](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-7.png)

* Similar to rolling but do not drop any capacity.
* New instances are deployed with a new version of the application.

**Immutable Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-8](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-8.png)

* Original instances are treated as immutable.
* Deployment starts at a temporary ASG with new instances containing the new application version.
* Method has the highest cost with the lowest risk for rolling back.

**Traffic Splitting Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-9](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-9.png)

* Allows allocation of traffic from different application versions.

**Blue/Green Deployment Visualization**

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-10](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-10.png)

* DNS Record can be adjusted to switch environments.
* Rollbacks are simple by doing the reverse.
* Lesser reliance on EB for deployments or switching over to new application versions.

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Environments and RDS

**Ways to use DB Services on EB Environment**

1. Create an RDS instance within an EB environment.
	\- it will be linked to that specific EB environment.

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-11](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-11.png)

* RDS Properties that can be accessed through this:
	* RDS_HOSTNAME
	* RDS_PORT
	* RDS_DB_NAME
	* RDS_USERNAME
	* RDS_PASSWORD

2. Create the RDS instance outside of Elastic Beanstalk.
	\- if done you have to manually create/add the environment properties to point at RDS.
	\- DB is outside the lifecycle of the environment.

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-12](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-12.png)

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-13](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-13.png)

* If you want to decouple an existing RDS within EB from an EB environment do the following:

	* Create an RDS Snapshot.
	* Enable Delete Protection on that RDS Instance.
	* Create a new EB environment with the same application version.
	* Ensure new environment can connect to the DB.
	* Swap environments (CNAME or DNS).
	* Terminate the old environment (Deletion of RDS will fail due to Delete Protection).
	* Go to CloudFormation to manually retain/delete resources related to old environment.

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Advanced Customization via .ebextension

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-14](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-14.png)

Ebextensions (.ebextensions)
	\- a way to customize Elastic Beanstalk environments.
	\- a folder created inside the Application Source Bundle (ZIP/WAR).

* Inside the folder, anything added which is JSON or YAML that has the .config extension is treated as an Ebextensions configuration file.
* Uses CFN format to create additional resources within the environment.

**Configuration Elements**

* option_settings
	\- allows you to set options of resources.

* Resources
	\- for creating entirely new resources.

Reference: https://github.com/awsdocs/elastic-beanstalk-samples/tree/master/configuration-files

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - HTTPS

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-15](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-15.png)

* To use HTTPS on EB, you need to apply an SSL certificate to the load balancer.
* Can be done through the EB console or through Ebextensions.

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Cloning

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-16](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-16.png)

* Allows creation of a new EB environment from an existing one.
* It copies options, environment variables, resources and other settings.
* EB also creates a copy of any AWS resources associated with the original environment.
* You cannot make any changes during the copy.
* A clone can make a copy of the RDS instance within that EB environment, but not its data.
* You can only clone an environment to a different platform (language) version of the same platform (language) branch.
* EB also does not include an unmanaged changes to resources in the clone.

Unmanaged Changes
	\- changes to AWS resources that are made using tools other the Elastic Beanstalk console.

CLI Command for Cloning: eb clone <existing-envname/>

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - Docker

**Ways to run Containerized Applications on Elastic Beanstalk**

1. Single Container Docker Mode
	\- can only 1 container on 1 Docker host.
	\- this mode uses 1 EC2 instance with Docker.
	\- only supports a single Docker container per EB environment.

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-17](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-17.png)

* To use this mode you have to provide one or more of a few different pieces of extra configuration.
	* Dockerfiles
		\- for building a Docker image and running it in a container.
	* Dockerrun.aws.json (version 1)
		\- this file makes use of an existing Docker Image and configures the images, ports, volumes and other Docker attributes to use.
	* Docker-compose.yml
		\- equivalent function to Docker’s docker compose command.

2. Multi-Container Deployments
	\- creates Docker environments that support multiple containers per EC2 instance.
	\- uses ECS Clusters to coordinate container deployments within the environment.

![Elastic Beanstalk In-Depth-18](images/Elastic%20Beanstalk%20In-Depth-18.png)

* Dockerrun.aws.json (version 2)
	\- defines the instances in the environment that run the same set of containers.
	\- found at the root of the Application Source Bundle.

* When using multi-container mode, images need to be stored in a Container Registry like ECR.
