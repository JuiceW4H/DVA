## CloudWatch Architecture

![Monitoring and Logging](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging.png)

* Provides services to ingest, store and manage metrics.
* A Public Services or at least have public space endpoints.

CloudWatch Agent
	\- for anything that is inside an instance or a service which can communicate back to the CW service.
	\- also for on-premises metrics.

Alarms
	- can be configured to generate notifications if the data which these alarms monitor breach normal levels based on criteria.
	- watches a metric over a time period.
	- value is either of a metric or threshold.

**State of an Alarm**

1. OK
2. Alarm
3. Insufficient Data

Namespace
	- a container for metrics within CloudWatch (e.g. AWS/EC2).
	- separates metrics from different services.

Datapoints
	- smallest components of CloudWatch.
	- contains a value, timestamps, and optional units of measure.
	- individual points of data that CW is monitoring.

Metric
	- time ordered set of data points.
	- each metric has a MetricName (e.g. CPUUtilization) and a Namespace (AWS/EC2).

Dimension
	- a name value pair which is provided when you add Datapoints into CW.
	- the way that the metrics differ from instances (e.g. Name = InstanceID, Value = i111111111).
	- used for aggregating data.

* When you publish Datapoints into CloudWatch you do so with a certain Resolution.

Period (Seconds)
	\- the length of time to evaluate the metric or expression to create each individual data point for an alarm.

Evaluation Period
	\- the number of the most recent periods, or data points, to evaluate when determining alarm state.

Datapoints to Alarm
	\- the number of data points within the evaluation period that must be breaching to cause the alarm to go to the ALARM state.

* The breaching data points do not have to be consecutive, they just must all be within the last number of data points equal to Evaluation Period.

Metrics Resolution
	- determines the minimum time period which can be specified and get a valid value.

Standard Resolution
	- 60 second resolution granularity meaning if you publish a CPU Utilization of 42%, it is viewed as 42% for 60 seconds.

High Resolution
	- 1 second resolution granularity.

**Data Retention**

* For less than 60 seconds, the data is retained for 3 hours.
* For 60 seconds, data is retained for 15 days.
* For 300 seconds (5 minutes), data is retained for 63 days.
* For 3600 seconds (1 hour), data is retained for 455 dats.

* As data ages, it’s aggregated and stored for longer with less resolution.

Statistics
	- a way to take data over a period and aggregate it in a certain way.
	- e.g. Min, Max, Average, Sum & etc.

Percentile
	- indicates the relative standing of a value in a dataset.
	- helps you get a better understanding of the distribution of your metric data.

* Resolution of a metric directly affects the resolution options you can have for an Alarm.

## CloudWatch Logs Architecture

![Monitoring and Logging-3](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging-3.png)

* CloudWatch Logs is a Regional Public Service which is designed to store, monitor, and provide access to logging data.
* Provides logging ingestion whether services are within AWS, On-premises environment, IoT or any application.

CloudWatch Agent
	- required to allow ingestion from almost any type of logging output.

**2 Side of CloudWatch Logs**

* Ingestion
	\- is concerned with getting the logs into the system.

* Subscription
	\- is concerned with what other products can use those logs for other activities.

**CloudWatch Logs Architecture**

![Monitoring and Logging-4](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging-4.png)

Logging Sources
	- can be anything which is able to send logging data.

**2 Parts of Log Events**

1. Timestamp
	\- when the raw message occurred.

2. Raw Message
	\- the actual message sent by the application which is sending in the logging data.

Log Stream
	- a sequence of log events.

Log Group
	- a collection of log streams.
	- by default, it stores logging data indefinitely.
	- where you set things like retention, permissions, and encryption.

Metric Filter
	- defined on Log Group.
	- looks for patterns in any Log Streams within that group.
	- creates a Metric.

**Way to get logging data out of CloudWatch Logs**

* S3 Export (Create-Export-Task)
		- manual process which can take up to 12 hours.
		- can only be encrypted with SSE-S3.
		- not realtime.

* CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions can be used to deliver realtime logging data to other destinations.

**CloudWatch Logs Subscription Architecture**

![Monitoring and Logging-5](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging-5.png)

* Subscriptions are done on a per Log Group basis.

**CloudWatch Logs Aggregation Architecture**

**Summary**

![Monitoring and Logging-7](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging-7.png)

## AWS X-Ray

* X-Ray is a distributed tracing application.
* Designed to track sessions through an application.

Tracing Header
	- a Tracing ID is generated when a user first connects to an application which has been configured for X-Ray and inserted to a Tracing Header.
	- used to track request through all the supported services that form part of your application.

Segments
	- one single block of data sent into X-Ray.
	- carries various details about the request.
	- can contain Subsegments.

Subsegments
	- more granular version of Segments.
	- calls to other services as part of a Segment.
	- shows details pertaining to endpoints or calls to databases.

Metadata
	\- primarily used to record custom data that you want to store in the trace.

Annotations
	\- key-value pairs that you want X-Ray to index for search.

Service Graph
	- JSON Document detailing services and resources which make up your application.

Service Map
	- uses Service Graph and the data it collects to generate a Service Map.
	- a visual representation of the Service Graph.
	- shows the flow through a distributed application.
	- includes response time, requests, and any errors or issues.

**Ways that X-Ray is provided with data**

![Monitoring and Logging-9](images/Monitoring%20and%20Logging-9.png)

* X-Ray Daemon listens for traffic on UDP Port 2000.

GetTraceSummaries
	\- get the list of trace IDs of the application.

BatchGetTraces 
	\- retrieves a list of traces specified by ID.

X-Forwarded-Host header
	\- primarily used in identifying the original host where the request originated from and not the IP address.

X-Forwarded-For header
	\- where X-Ray fetches the client IP from.
